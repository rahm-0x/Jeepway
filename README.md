# 🚐 Jeepway

**Jeepway** is a Flutter web/mobile app for live-tracking jeepneys in the Philippines. Users can register as Riders or Drivers, share live GPS data, and view jeepney routes on an interactive map.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (web + mobile)
- **Firebase**: Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB
- **Flutter Map** + `latlong2` + `flutter_map_marker_popup`
- **Geolocator**: for live location tracking

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jeepway.git
cd jeepway
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

Make sure `firebase_options.dart` is generated by `flutterfire configure`, or manually edit it with your Firebase project credentials:

```dart
// lib/firebase_options.dart
apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com"
// ...
```

### 4. Run on Chrome

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

> **Note:** Uses `webExperimentalForceLongPolling` to avoid Firestore 400 errors on web.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

- `/signup` → Firebase Auth + redirects to `/onboarding`
- `/onboarding` → Choose Rider or Driver  
  - Riders go straight to home  
  - Drivers go through `/driver-verification` → `/driver-registration`
